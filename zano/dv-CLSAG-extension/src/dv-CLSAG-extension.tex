\section{Introduction}
In this paper we present a Schnorr-like linkable ring signature scheme we call \nicefrac{d}{v}-CLSAG that is extension for d-CLSAG scheme proposed in \cite{clsag}. The proposed extension allows the use of different group generators for different layers of the ring members: $\bm{pk} \coloneqq \bm{sk} \circ \bm{G},\ \bm{G} = (G_{k_0},\dots,G_{k_{d-1}}) \in \texttt{G}^d$, while the original scheme assumes the use of the same generator $G$ across all layers: $\bm{pk} \coloneqq \bm{sk} \circ \bm{G},\ \bm{G} = (G,\dots,G) \in \texttt{G}^d$. To improve the signature size we use key aggregation techniques in the same way, but for distinct group generators $\{G_k\}$ individually. Note, that we don't require the absence of efficiently-computable discrete logarithm relations between $\{G_k\}$. However, it might be possible, that adding such a limitation would allow us to reduce the signature size. This is the subject of future studies. 

We provide the security statements for the proposed updated scheme in \cref{t_2}, \cref{t_3}, and \cref{t_4}. The proofs mostly correspond to the original proofs in \cite{clsag}. We use the same numeration for theorems, definitions, and lemmas as in the original work. For the reader’s convenience, all changes are highlighted.

\section{Application}
\nicefrac{d}{v}-CLSAG may be used in cases when different group generators for different ring layers are necessary.

For instance, in the Zano project a user can transfer an arbitrary number of assets within a single transaction. The method used for implementing the assets requires using 2 distinct generators, $G$ and $X$, in a 3-layer arrangement $(G, G, X)$ for a normal transaction and in a 5-layer arrangement $(G, G, X, X, G)$ for a Proof-of-Stake mining transaction (see also \cite{zarcanum}) for all ring members. Using \nicefrac{3}{2}-CLSAG and \nicefrac{5}{2}-CLSAG correspondingly in that context solves the problem, while the signature size is increased by only $n$ scalar elements, where $n$ is the ring size.

\begin{definition}[\nicefrac{d}{v}\textbf{-CLSAG}] \label{d_dclsag}
    The tuple (\textsc{Setup, KeyGen, Sign, Verify, Link}) as follows is a d-LRS signature scheme.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item[--] \textsc{Setup} $\rightarrow$ par. First, \textsc{Setup} selects a prime p, a group \texttt{G} with prime order p, selects d cryptographic hash functions $\mathcal{H}^s_0, \dots , \mathcal{H}^s_{d-1}$ (modeled as random oracles) with codomain $\texttt{F}_p$, \hl{selects $v$ group generators $G_0, \dots, G_{v-1} \in \texttt{G}$, where $v \leq d$} uniformly at random\hl{, selects surjection $g:[0, d-1] \rightarrow [0, v-1]$ that maps indices of elements of $\bm{G}$ to the corresponding generators}, selects a cryptographic hash function $\mathcal{H}^p$ with codomain \texttt{G}. Then, \textsc{Setup} outputs the group parameter tuple and the hash functions:\\ $par~\coloneqq~(p, \texttt{G}, d, \mhl{v, g, \{G_k\}_{k=0}^{v-1}}, \{\mathcal{H}^s_j\}^{d-1}_{j=0}, \mathcal{H}^p)$.\footnote{Note that domain separation can be used here to take one $\mathcal{H}^s$ and construct each $\mathcal{H}^s_j$ by defining $\mathcal{H}^s_j(x)~\coloneqq~\mathcal{H}^s(j~\parallel~x)$.}

       \item[--] \textsc{KeyGen} $\rightarrow$ (\textbf{sk, pk}). When required for a new key, \textsc{KeyGen} samples a fresh secret key and computes the associated public key:
       \begin{align*}
           \textbf{sk} &= (z_0,z_1,\dots,z_{d-1}) \leftarrow (\texttt{F}^*_p)^d
           \\
           \textbf{pk} &\coloneqq \textbf{sk} \circ \textbf{G} = (Z_0, Z_1, \dots, Z_{d-1}) \in \texttt{G}^d
        \end{align*}
        where $\textbf{G} = \mhl{(G_{g(0)}, \dots, G_{g(d-1)})} \in \texttt{G}^d$. \textsc{KeyGen} outputs (\textbf{sk, pk}). We say $z_0$ is the linking key, the remaining keys ${z_j}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ are the auxiliary keys, and we denote the linking key with x.

        \item[--] \textsc{Sign}$(m, Q, \textbf{sk}) \rightarrow \{\bot_{Sign}, \sigma\}$. \textsc{Sign} takes as input a message $m \in \{0, 1\}^*$, a ring $Q = (\textbf{pk}_0,\dots,\textbf{pk}_{n-1})$ for ring members $\textbf{pk}_i = (\mhl{Z_{i,0}, \dots, Z_{i,d-1}}) \in \texttt{G}^d$, and a secret key $\textbf{sk} = (\mhl{z_0, \dots, z_{d-1}}) \in (\texttt{F}_p^*)^d$. \textsc{Sign} does the following.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $Q \nsubseteq \texttt{G}^{d \times n}$ for some $n$, \textsc{Sign} outputs $\bot_{Sign}$ and terminates.

            \item Otherwise, \textsc{Sign} parses\footnote{Note that this parsing always succeeds if \textsc{Sign} does not fail in the previous step.} $Q$ to obtain each $\textbf{pk}_i$. If the public key associated with the input \textbf{sk} is not a ring member in $Q$, then \textsc{Sign} outputs $\bot_{Sign}$ and terminates.

            \item Otherwise, \textsc{Sign} finds the signing index $l$, such that $\textbf{pk}_l = \textbf{sk} \circ \mhl{(G_{g(0)}, \dots, G_{g(d-1)})}$. \textsc{Sign} samples $\mhl{ \{\alpha_k\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \in (\texttt{F}_p)^v}$ uniformly at random, samples $\mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i \neq l}^{v-1} \in (\texttt{F}_p)^{v(n-1)}}$ uniformly at random, and computes the group elements $H_i = \mathcal{H}^p(X_i)$ for each $i$. \textsc{Sign} computes the aggregation coefficients $\mhl{\{\mu_j\}_{j=0}^{d-1}}$, the linking tag $\mathfrak{T}$, the auxiliary group elements $\{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$, and the aggregated public keys:

\section{Proofs of Security}

\begin{lemma}
For any $Q \subseteq \mathcal{PK}$, for any private key $\mhl{sk = (\{z_j\}_j)} \in Q$, the map \hl{$sk \rightarrow \sum_j{\mu_j z_j}$} where $\mu_j$ are computed as in \cref{d_dclsag} is a collision-resistant function.
\end{lemma}

\setcounter{theorem}{1}

\begin{theorem}[\textbf{Hardness of Discrete Logarithms of Linear Combinations Implies Unforgeability}] \label{t_2}
If a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the unforgeability exists for the scheme of \cref{d_dclsag} that makes $\kappa'$ corruption oracle queries, then there exists a $(2(t + t_0) + t_1), \epsilon(\frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta})-\mu, \floor{\frac{q}{d}}$-solver of the $2d\kappa'$-one-more discrete logarithm of linear combinations problem in \texttt{G} for some negligible $\mu$ and some constants $t_0, t_1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{claimproof}
Assume \texttt{A} is a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the non-slanderability game of Definition 8. We wrap \texttt{A} in an algorithm \texttt{B}. The algorithm \texttt{B} executes \texttt{A} in a black box, handling oracle queries for \texttt{A}. Then, \texttt{B} regurgitates the output of \texttt{A} together with an index $idx$. This way, \texttt{B} is sutable for use in the forking lemma. We wrap $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a master algorithm \texttt{M} that is a $(2(t + t_0) + t_1), \epsilon(\frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta})-\mu, \floor{\frac{q}{d}}$-solver of the $\kappa$-one-more discrete logarithm of linear combinations problem in \texttt{G}, where $\eta$ is as defined in Lemma 1.

If \texttt{A} produces a successful forgery, each verification query of the form \[c_{l+1} = \mhl{\mathcal{H}^s(m \parallel Q \parallel \{L_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \parallel \{R_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})}\] occurs in the transcript between \texttt{A} and the random oracle $\mathcal{H}^s$. Indeed, the signature triple produced by \texttt{A} passes verification, so each challenge $c_{l+1}$, whether made with oracle queries in the transcript or not, must be matched by random oracle queries made by the verifier. The prover cannot guess the output of such a query before making it except with negligible probability. Hence, if \texttt{A} outputs a valid signature, all verification challenges are computed by an actual oracle query. See \cite{lsag_adhoc} for a formal proof of this fact. Since all verification challenges are found through genuine oracle queries, which are well-ordered, there exists a first $\mathcal{H}^s$ query made by \texttt{A} for computing verification challenges, say $c = \mathcal{H}^s(m \parallel Q \parallel \mhl{\{L_k^*\}} \parallel \mhl{\{R_k^*\}})$. This was not necessarily the first query made to $\mathcal{H}^s$ overall, though; say it was the $\mhl{a^{th}}$ query. Although the ring index for this query may not have been decided when this query was first issued by \texttt{A}, be the end of the transcript the ring index has been decided.

We construct \texttt{B} in the following way. We grant \texttt{B} access to the same oracles as \texttt{A}. Any oracle queries made by \texttt{A} are passed along by \texttt{B} to the oracles. The responses are recorded and then passed back to \texttt{A}. The algorithm \texttt{B} works by finding two indices to augment the output of \texttt{A}. First, \texttt{B} finds the $\mathcal{H}^s$ query index $\mhl{a}$ corresponding to the first verification challenge computed by \texttt{A} used in verifying the purported forgery. Second, \texttt{B} inspects the transcript of \texttt{A} to find the anonymity set index $l$ in the transcript such that $c = c_{l+1}$ and $\mhl{\{R_k^{*}\} = \{R_{k,l}\}}$ and $\mhl{\{L_k^{*}\} = \{L_{k,l}\}}$. Now \texttt{B} outputs $idx = (\mhl{a}, l)$ along with whatever \texttt{A} outputs. Clearly, \texttt{B} makes the same number of corruptions oracle queries as \texttt{A}.

Note \texttt{B} succeeds whenever \texttt{A} does and runs in time at most $t$ just like \texttt{A}, except for some additional time $t_0$ to search the transcript for $idx$. Since \texttt{B} is suitable for use in the forking lemma, we can use $\mathcal{F}^B$ to construct \texttt{M}.

The algorithm $\mathcal{F}^b$ is granted oracle access to the same oracles as \texttt{B} except $\mathcal{H}^s$ and \texttt{SO}. The algorithm $\mathcal{F}^B$ simulates \texttt{SO} queries made by \texttt{B} by simple back-patching of $\mathcal{H}^s$ and simulates the other queries made to $\mathcal{H}^s$ queries made by \texttt{B} using the random tapes \textbf{h, h*} as described in Section 3.1. All other oracle queries made by \texttt{B} are passed along by $\mathcal{F}^B$ to the actual oracles and handed back to \texttt{B}.

Note that $\mathcal{F}^B$ runs in time $2(t + t_0)$ and (with probability at least $\epsilon (\frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta})$) outputs a pair of valid signature triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m', Q', \sigma')$. The messages and anonymity sets are selected before the fork point in the transcripts, so $m = m'$ and $Q = Q'$. Moreover, $\mathcal{F}^B$ makes at most $2\kappa'$ corruption queries. The challenges for the two transcripts are distinct since the forking algorithm outputs the failure symbol $\bot$ and terminates if the challenges for $c_{l+1}$ are the same in each transcript.
\[
c_{l+1} \leftarrow \mathcal{H}_0^s(\mhl{m \parallel Q \parallel \{L_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \parallel \{R_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})}) \rightarrow c'_{l+1} 
\]
We wrap $\mathcal{F}^B$ in an algorithm \texttt{M} that plays the $\kappa$-one-more discrete logarithm game of Definition 1 for $\kappa = 2 \cdot d \cdot \kappa'$. The algorithm \texttt{M} has corruption oracle access and runs $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a black box, passing corruption oracle queries made by $\mathcal{F}^B$ along. The algorithm \texttt{M} finds the following system of equations in the transcripts by inspecting the verification challenge queries:
\[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
    \{L_{k,l}\} = \{s_{k,l} G_k + c_l W_{k,l}\} &= \{s'_{k,l} G_k + c'_l W_{k,l}\} \\
    \{R_{k,l}\} = \{s_{k,l} H_l + c_l \mathfrak{W}_k\} &= \{s'_{k,l} H_l + c'_l \mathfrak{W}_k\}
\end{aligned}}\]
This \texttt{M} has enough information to compute
\[\mhl{
    \{W_{k,l}\} = \left\{\frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l} G_k\right\}, \quad \{\mathfrak{W}_k\} = \left\{\frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l} H_l\right\}
}\]
and therefore the private key\hl{s} $\mhl{w_k = \frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l}}$.

\noindent
Formally, \texttt{M} operates as follows.

{
    \renewcommand\labelenumi{(\theenumi)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \texttt{M} inputs the set of discrete logarithm challenge public keys $S = \Big\{ \widetilde{pk}_i \Big\}_{i=0}^{q-1}$.

        \item \texttt{M} partitions the challenge keys into lists of $d$ keys
        \[\begin{aligned}
            pk_0 = &(Z_{0,0}, \dots, Z_{0,d-1}) &&\coloneqq (\widetilde{pk}_0, \dots, \widetilde{pk}_{d-1}) \\
            pk_1 = &(Z_{1,0}, \dots, Z_{1,d-1}) &&\coloneqq (\widetilde{pk}_d, \dots, \widetilde{pk}_{2d-1}) \\
            &\vdots
        \end{aligned}\]
        obtaining $S \coloneqq \{pk_i\}_{i=0}^{\floor{\frac{q}{d}}}$.

        \item \texttt{M} picks two random tapes \textbf{h, h'} to simulate oracle query responses for $\mathcal{F}^B$.

        \item \texttt{M} executes $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a black box, using $S$ as input. Upon receiving a corruption query from $\mathcal{F}^B$ on some $pk_i$, \texttt{M} makes a \texttt{CO} query on each $Z_{j,i}$ passing $sk_i$ back to $\mathcal{F}^B$. Each corruption query made by $\mathcal{F}^B$ consists of $d$ corruption queries made to \texttt{CO} by \texttt{M}.

        \item If $\mathcal{F}^B$ fails, or if $\mathcal{F}^B$ succeeds with all zero coefficients $\mhl{\mu_j}$, then \texttt{M} samples random \hl{$\{w_k\} \in (\texttt{F}_p)^v$}, samples a random subset of challenge keys $\{pk_j^*\}_j \subseteq S$, samples random coefficients $\{h_j\}_j$, outputs $\mhl{\{w_k\}}, \{pk_j^*\}_j, \{h_j\}_j$, and terminates.

        \item Otherwise, \texttt{M} obtains two signature triples with the same message and ring, $(m, Q, \sigma), (m, Q, \sigma')$ at at least one non-zero aggregation coefficient. \texttt{M} computes the challenge discrete logarithm\hl{s $w_k = \frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l}$}. \texttt{M} outputs $\mhl{w_k, \{\mu_j\}_j}$, and $\mhl{\{Z_{l,j}\}_j}$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

Denote with $t_1$ the time it takes for \texttt{M} to inspect the transcript, perform field operations, and process corruption queries for $\mathcal{F}^B$. Then the algorithm \texttt{M} runs in time at most $2(t + t_0) + t_1$.

To complete the proof, consider the overall success probability and timing of \texttt{M}. Since \texttt{A} is a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the unforgeability game and these are successful signatures, there must be at least one query made to \texttt{SO} corresponding to an uncorrupted challenge key linking to these signatures. In particular, \hl{$w_k \cdot G_k = W_{k,l} = \sum_{j:g(j)=k}{\mu_j Z_{l,j}}$} for some $\mhl{(\{Z_{l,j}\}_j)} \in Q$. The algorithm \texttt{M} succeeds at forking \texttt{B} and at least one coefficient $\mhl{\mu_j}$ is non-zero; we denote the probability of obtaining any zero coefficients as $\mu$. We note that $\mu$ is negligible under the random oracle model. Thus, \texttt{M} runs in time at most $2(t + t_0) + t_1$, has success probability exceeding $\epsilon (\frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta}) - \mu$.
\end{claimproof}

The proof of \cref{t_2} demonstrates that the validity of a triple implies that the aggregated private key\hl{s $w_k$ are} the discrete logarithms of the aggregated linking tag\hl{s $\mathfrak{W}_k$} with respect to $H_l$ and \hl{are} also the discrete logarithm\hl{s} of the aggregated key\hl{s $W_{k,l}$} with respect to $\mhl{G_k}$. In this way, the linking tag of a valid signature must be the linking tag corresponding to at least one ring member, except possibly with negligible probability.

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{corollary}[\textbf{No Alien Linking Tags}]
If there exists a PPT algorithm \texttt{A} that produces a valid signature triple $(m, Q, \sigma)$ with the scheme in \cref{d_dclsag}, then there exists a ring member in $Q$ whose aggregated key\hl{s $W_{k,l}$ have} the same discrete logarithm\hl{s $w_k$} with respect to $\mhl{G_k}$ as \hl{$\mathfrak{W}_k$ have} with respect to $H_l$, and \hl{these $w_k$ are} known to \texttt{A} (except possibly with negligible probability).
\end{corollary}

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{theorem} \label{t_3}
The scheme in \cref{d_dclsag} is linkable under Definition 5 and Definition 6.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We show that valid, non-oracle signature triples from the scheme in \cref{d_dclsag} satisfying the corrupted key conditions in the game of Definition 5 always link. Hence, any algorithm fails at that game except with negligible probability.

    Assume that \texttt{A}, while playing the game of ACST linkability from Definition 5, produces a pair of valid, non-oracle signature triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m^*, Q^*, \sigma^*)$ such that at most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. This algorithm can be forked and rewound as above to compute the aggregated private key used in computing each signature, say $\mhl{\bm{w}=\{w_{g(j)}\}, \bm{w^*}=\{w_{g(j)}^*\},\ j=0 \dots d-1}$. At most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. Since \texttt{A} has knowledge of $\mhl{\bm{w}}$, then $\mhl{\bm{w}}$ is corrupted or outside of $S$, and likewise $\mhl{\bm{w^*}}$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. Since at most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ can be corrupted or outside of $S$, we conclude $\mhl{\bm{w} = \bm{w^*}}$.

    Since key aggregation is preimage-resistant by its construction using hash functions and $\mhl{\bm{w} \circ \bm{G}}$ is the aggregated public key for some public key $\mhl{\bm{pk}_l = (\{Z_{l,j}\}_j)} \in Q \cap Q^*$, $\mhl{\bm{w}}$ must be aggregated from a private key $\mhl{(\{z_{l,j}\}_j)}$ using the aggregation function. In both the case of single-key-oriented linkability and full-key-oriented linkability, the linkability tags are therefore exactly equal. Hence, with probability 1, the pair of triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m^*, Q^*, \sigma^*)$ are linked, and \texttt{A} fails at ACST linkability except with negligible probability.

    Similarly, an algorithm that outputs $q+1$ unlinked signatures can be rewound to compute $2(q+1)$ signatures from which $q+1$ aggregated keys can be computed. Moreover, if these signatures are unlinked, then the $q + 1$ aggregated keys are distinct, violating $q$-pigeonhole linkability.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{t_4}
If there exists a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the linkable anonymity game of Definition 9 under the construction of \cref{d_dclsag}, then there exists a $(t + t', \epsilon/2, q)$-solver of the RO-DDH\hl{\footnote{\hl{In this theorem and its proof we employ a slightly modified version of the RO-DDH (as defined in Definition 2), where the fixed generator $G$ is replaced with the fixed generator $G_{g(0)}$.}}} game of Definition 2 for some $t'$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let \texttt{A} be such a solver of the linkable anonymity game. We will construct an algorithm \texttt{B} that executes \texttt{A} in a black box and is a solver of the RO-DDH game, acting as the challenger for \texttt{A}; the algorithm will pass on $\mathcal{H}^p$ random oracle queries to its own challenger, flip coins for $\mhl{\{\mathcal{H}_j^s\}}$ random oracle queries, and simulate signing oracle queries by backpatching. We assume that \texttt{B} keeps internal tables to maintain consistency between the random oracle queries needed to simulate signing oracle queries.

The algorithm \texttt{B} operates as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] \texttt{B} receives a set of tuples $\{(R_i, R'_i, R''_i)\}_{i=0}^{q-1}$ from its challenger, and chooses a bit $b' \in \{0, 1\}$ uniformly at random. Note that \texttt{B} does not know if its tuples are RO-DDH triples or not, as its challenger chose a secret bit $b \in \{0,1\}$ uniformly at random to determine this.

    \item[--] For all $i \in [0; q)$, \texttt{B} defines $\mhl{Z_{i,0}} \coloneqq R_i$ and records the $\mathcal{H}^p$ oracle mapping $\mathcal{H}^p(\mhl{Z_{i,0}}) = R'_i$. It chooses $\{z_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ from $\texttt{F}_p$ uniformly at random, and builds a set of public keys $S \coloneqq \{\mhl{(Z_{i,0}, z_{i,1}G_{g(1)}, \dots, z_{i,d-1}G_{g(d-1)})}\}_{i=0}^{q-1}$. \texttt{B} provides the set $S$ to \texttt{A}.

    \item[--] \texttt{A} returns indices $0 \leq i_0,i_1 < q$ to \texttt{B}.

    \item[--] \texttt{B} receives signing oracle queries of the form \texttt{SO}$(m, Q, pk)$, where $0 \leq l < q$ is the index of $pk \in Q, pk \in S$, and $|Q| = n$. There are two cases, which determine how \texttt{B} simulates the oracle response, flipping coins for $\mhl{\{\mathcal{H}_j^s\}}$ oracle queries:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If it is the case that $\{pk_{i_0}, pk_{i_1}\} \not\subset Q$ or $pk \notin \{pk_{i_0},pk_{i_1}\}$, then \texttt{B} proceeds with its signing oracle simulation using the key $pk$.

        \item Otherwise, there exists a bit $c \in \{0, 1\}$ such that $pk = pk_{i_c}$. In this case, \texttt{B} sets $c' \coloneqq c \oplus b'$ and proceeds with its signing oracle simulation using the key $pk_{i_{c'}}$. This is, if $b' = 0$, then \texttt{B} simulates a signature using the requested key from the player-provided index set. If instead $b' = 1$, then \texttt{B} simulates a signature using the other key.
    \end{enumerate}

    In either case, \texttt{B} parses the public key set $Q$ provided by \texttt{A}. For any key $pk_i \coloneqq (\mhl{Z'_{i,0}, Z'_{i,1}, \dots, Z'_{i, d-1}}) \in Q \setminus S$, it makes oracle queries to its challenger to obtain $\mathcal{H}^p(\mhl{Z'_{i,0}})$. Then \texttt{B} simulates the signature:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Define a map $\pi : [0, n) \rightarrow[0, q) \cup \{ \bot \}$ that maps indices of elements of $Q$ to the corresponding elements of $S$ (or returns the distinguished failure symbol $\bot$ for indices not mapping to elements of $S$), and let $0 \leq l < n$ be the index of $pk \in Q$.

        \item Choose $c_l, \mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i=0}^{v-1,n-1}} \in \texttt{F}_p$ uniformly at random.

        \item Since $pk \in S$ by construction, $\pi(l) \neq \bot$. Set $\mathfrak{T} \mhl{\coloneqq \mathfrak{D}_0} \coloneqq R''_{\pi(l)}$ and $\{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ such that each $\mathfrak{D}_j \coloneqq z_{\pi(l),j} \mathcal{H}^p(Z_{\pi(l),0})$.

        \item Define the following:
        \[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
            \mu_j &\leftarrow \mathcal{H}_j^s(Q, \{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=0}^{d-1}) \hspace{30pt} \text{for} \ j \in [0, d)
            \\
            W_{k,i} &\coloneqq \left\{ \begin{aligned}
                &\sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j Z_{\pi(i),j} \quad &(\pi(i) \neq \bot)
                \\
                &\sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j Z'_{i,j} \quad &(\pi(i) = \bot)
            \end{aligned}\right.
            \\
            \mathfrak{W}_k &\coloneqq \sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j \mathfrak{D}_j
        \end{aligned}}\]

        \item For each $i = l, l+1, \dots, n-1, 0, \dots, l-1$ (that is, indexing modulo n), define the following:
        \[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
            L_{k,i} &\coloneqq s_{k,i} G_k + c_i W_{k,i}
            \\
            R_{k,i} &\coloneqq \left\{ \begin{aligned}
                & s_{k,i} \mathcal{H}^p(Z_{\pi(i),0}) + c_i \mathfrak{W}_k \quad & (\pi(i) \neq \bot)
                \\
                & s_{k,i} \mathcal{H}^p(Z'_{i,0}) + c_i \mathfrak{W}_k \quad & (\pi(i) = \bot )
            \end{aligned}\right.
            \\
            c_{i+1} &\leftarrow \mathcal{H}_0^s(m, Q, \{L_{k,i}\}_{k=0}^{v-1}, \{R_{k,i}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})
        \end{aligned}}\]
    
        \item \texttt{B} returns to \texttt{A} the tuple $(c_0, \mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i=0}^{v-1,n-1}, \{\mathfrak{D}_j\}})$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item[--] \texttt{A} returns a bit $b^*$ to \texttt{B}.

    \item[--] If $b^* = b'$, then \texttt{B} returns $0$ to its challenger. Otherwise, it returns 1.
\end{itemize}

It is the case that \texttt{B} wins the RO-DDH game precisely when it correctly guesses the bit $b$ chosen by its challenger. Hence $\mathbb{P}[\text{\texttt{B} wins}] = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \ \rightarrow \ 0 | b = 0] + \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \ \rightarrow \ 1 | b = 1]$.

if $b = 1$, then the RO-DDH challenger provided random points $\{R''_i\}$ that \texttt{B} used in its simulated signatures, so \texttt{A} can do no better than random chance at determining $b'$. Since $\texttt{B} \rightarrow 1$ exactly when \texttt{A} loses the linkable anonymity game, we have $\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \rightarrow 1 | b = 1] = \frac{1}{2}$.

On the other hand, if $b = 0$, then the RO-DDH challenger provided structured tuples that \texttt{B} used in its simulated signatures, and \texttt{A} wins the linkable anonymity game with non-negligible advantage $\epsilon$ over random chance. Since $\texttt{B} \rightarrow 0$ exactly when \texttt{A} wins the linkable anonymity game, we have $\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \rightarrow 0 | b = 0] = \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$.

This means \texttt{B} wins the RO-DDH game with probability $\mathbb{P}[\text{\texttt{B} wins}] = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and has non-negligible advantage $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Further, \texttt{B} finishes with an added time $t'$ used in simulating oracle queries and performing lookups. Hence, \texttt{B} is a $(t + t', \epsilon/2, q)$-solver of the RO-DDH game.
