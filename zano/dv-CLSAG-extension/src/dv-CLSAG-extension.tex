\section{Introduction}
In this paper we present a Schnorr-like linkable ring signature scheme we call \nicefrac{d}{v}-CLSAG that is extension for d-CLSAG scheme proposed in \cite{clsag}. The proposed extension allows the use of different group generators for different layers of the ring members: $\bm{pk} \coloneqq \bm{sk} \circ \bm{G},\ \bm{G} = (G_{k_0},\dots,G_{k_{d-1}}) \in \texttt{G}^d$, while the original scheme assumes the use of the same generator $G$ across all layers: $\bm{pk} \coloneqq \bm{sk} \circ \bm{G},\ \bm{G} = (G,\dots,G) \in \texttt{G}^d$. To improve the signature size we use key aggregation techniques in the same way, but for distinct group generators $\{G_k\}$ individually. Note, that we don't require the absence of efficiently-computable discrete logarithm relations between $\{G_k\}$. However, it might be possible, that adding such a limitation would allow us to reduce the signature size. This is the subject of future studies. 

We provide the security statements for the proposed updated scheme in \cref{t_2}, \cref{t_3}, and \cref{t_4}. The proofs mostly correspond to the original proofs in \cite{clsag}. We use the same numeration for theorems, definitions, and lemmas as in the original work. For the reader’s convenience, all changes are highlighted.

\section{Acknowledgements}
The author would like to express gratitude to Cypher Stack and Aaron Feickert for their review of this work \cite{cs_review_report}. The initial revision of this paper contained minor flaws in \cref{d_dclsag} and significant issues in the proof of \cref{t_2}, some of which were also present in the original CLSAG. Although no practical vulnerabilities were found arising from them, these findings were subsequently addressed and rectified with the invaluable suggestions provided by Aaron Feickert and Cypher Stack.


\section{Application}
\nicefrac{d}{v}-CLSAG may be used in cases when different group generators for different ring layers are necessary.

For instance, in the Zano project a user can transfer an arbitrary number of assets within a single transaction. The method used for implementing the assets requires using 2 distinct generators, $G$ and $X$, in a 3-layer arrangement $(G, G, X)$ for a normal transaction and in a 5-layer arrangement $(G, G, X, X, G)$ for a Proof-of-Stake mining transaction (see also \cite{zarcanum}) for all ring members. Using \nicefrac{3}{2}-CLSAG and \nicefrac{5}{2}-CLSAG correspondingly in that context solves the problem, while the signature size is increased by only $n$ scalar elements, where $n$ is the ring size.

\begin{definition}[\nicefrac{d}{v}\textbf{-CLSAG}] \label{d_dclsag}
    The tuple (\textsc{Setup, KeyGen, Sign, Verify, Link}) as follows is a d-LRS signature scheme.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item[--] \textsc{Setup} $\rightarrow$ par. First, \textsc{Setup} selects a prime p, a group \texttt{G} with prime order p, selects d cryptographic hash functions $\mathcal{H}^s_0, \dots , \mathcal{H}^s_{d-1}$ (modeled as random oracles) with codomain $\texttt{F}_p$, \hl{selects $v$ nonzero\footnote{We define a generator as nonzero if it is not the identity element of the group.} group generators $G_0, \dots, G_{v-1} \in \texttt{G}$, where $v \leq d$, selects surjection $g:[0, d-1] \rightarrow [0, v-1]$ that maps indices of elements of $\bm{G}=(G_{g(0)}, \dots, G_{g(d-1)}) \in \texttt{G}^d$ to the corresponding generators}, selects a cryptographic hash function $\mathcal{H}^p$ with codomain \texttt{G}. Then, \textsc{Setup} outputs the group parameter tuple and the hash functions:\\ $par~\coloneqq~(p, \texttt{G}, d, \mhl{v, g, \{G_k\}_{k=0}^{v-1}}, \{\mathcal{H}^s_j\}^{d-1}_{j=0}, \mathcal{H}^p)$.\footnote{Note that domain separation can be used here to take one $\mathcal{H}^s$ and construct each $\mathcal{H}^s_j$ by defining $\mathcal{H}^s_j(x)~\coloneqq~\mathcal{H}^s(j~\parallel~x)$.}

       \item[--] \textsc{KeyGen} $\rightarrow$ (\textbf{sk, pk}). When required for a new key, \textsc{KeyGen} samples a fresh secret key and computes the associated public key:
       \begin{align*}
           \textbf{sk} &= (z_0,z_1,\dots,z_{d-1}) \leftarrow (\texttt{F}^*_p)^d
           \\
           \textbf{pk} &\coloneqq \textbf{sk} \circ \textbf{G} = (Z_0, Z_1, \dots, Z_{d-1}) \in \texttt{G}^d
        \end{align*}
        \textsc{KeyGen} outputs (\textbf{sk, pk}). We say $z_0$ is the linking key, the remaining keys $\{z_j\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ are the auxiliary keys, and we denote the linking key with x.

        \item[--] \textsc{Sign}$(m, Q, \textbf{sk}) \rightarrow \{\bot_{Sign}, \sigma\}$. \textsc{Sign} takes as input a message $m \in \{0, 1\}^*$, a ring $Q = (\textbf{pk}_0,\dots,\textbf{pk}_{n-1})$ for ring members $\textbf{pk}_i = (\mhl{Z_{i,0}, \dots, Z_{i,d-1}}) \in \texttt{G}^d$, and a secret key $\textbf{sk} = (\mhl{z_0, \dots, z_{d-1}}) \in (\texttt{F}_p^*)^d$. \textsc{Sign} does the following.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $Q \nsubseteq \texttt{G}^{d \times n}$ for some $n$, \textsc{Sign} outputs $\bot_{Sign}$ and terminates.

            \item Otherwise, \textsc{Sign} parses\footnote{Note that this parsing always succeeds if \textsc{Sign} does not fail in the previous step.} $Q$ to obtain each $\textbf{pk}_i$. If the public key associated with the input \textbf{sk} is not a ring member in $Q$, then \textsc{Sign} outputs $\bot_{Sign}$ and terminates.

            \item Otherwise, \textsc{Sign} finds the signing index $l$, such that $\textbf{pk}_l = \textbf{sk} \circ \mhl{\bm{G}}$. \textsc{Sign} samples $\mhl{ \{\alpha_k\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \in (\texttt{F}_p)^v}$ uniformly at random, samples $\mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i \neq l}^{v-1} \in (\texttt{F}_p)^{v(n-1)}}$ uniformly at random, and computes the group elements $H_i = \mathcal{H}^p(X_i)$ for each $i$. \textsc{Sign} computes the aggregation coefficients $\mhl{\{\mu_j\}_{j=0}^{d-1}}$, the linking tag $\mathfrak{T}$, the auxiliary group elements $\{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$, and the aggregated public keys:

    \hl{is collision resistant.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{claimproof}
Follows immediately from the random oracle model we use
for $\mathcal{H}^s$.
\end{claimproof}

\setcounter{theorem}{1}

\begin{theorem}[\hl{\textbf{Hardness of Discrete Logarithm Implies Unforgeability}}] \label{t_2}
If a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the unforgeability \hl{game} exists for the scheme of \cref{d_dclsag} that makes $\kappa'$ corruption oracle queries, then there exists a \hl{$(2(t + t_0) + t_1, {( \frac{q-\kappa'}{q} )^2 \epsilon ( \frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta} ) ( \frac{1}{q} )}, q)$-solver of the discrete logarithm problem in \texttt{G}} for some constants $t_0, t_1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{claimproof}
Assume \texttt{A} is a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the non-slanderability game of Definition 8. We wrap \texttt{A} in an algorithm \texttt{B}. The algorithm \texttt{B} executes \texttt{A} in a black box, handling oracle queries for \texttt{A}. Then, \texttt{B} regurgitates the output of \texttt{A} together with an index $idx$. This way, \texttt{B} is sutable for use in the forking lemma. We wrap $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a master algorithm \texttt{M} that is a \hl{$(2(t + t_0) + t_1, {( \frac{q-\kappa'}{q} )^2 \epsilon ( \frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta} ) ( \frac{1}{q} )}, q)$}-solver of the \hl{discrete logarithm problem} in \texttt{G}, where $\eta$ is as defined in Lemma 1.

If \texttt{A} produces a successful forgery, each verification query of the form
\[
    c_{l+1} = \mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s(m \parallel Q \parallel \{L_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \parallel \{R_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})}
\]
occurs in the transcript between \texttt{A} and the random oracle $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$. Indeed, the signature triple produced by \texttt{A} passes verification, so each challenge $c_{l+1}$, whether made with oracle queries in the transcript or not, must be matched by random oracle queries made by the verifier. The prover cannot guess the output of such a query before making it except with negligible probability. Hence, if \texttt{A} outputs a valid signature, all verification challenges are computed by an actual oracle query. See \cite{lsag_adhoc} for a formal proof of this fact. Since all verification challenges are found through genuine oracle queries, which are well-ordered, there exists a first $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ query made by \texttt{A} for computing verification challenges, say $c = \mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}(m \parallel Q \parallel \mhl{\{L_k^*\}} \parallel \mhl{\{R_k^*\}})$. This was not necessarily the first query made to $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ overall, though; say it was the $\mhl{a^{th}}$ query. Although the ring index for this query may not have been decided when this query was first issued by \texttt{A}, by the end of the transcript the ring index has been decided.

We construct \texttt{B} in the following way. We grant \texttt{B} access to the same oracles as \texttt{A}. Any oracle queries made by \texttt{A} are passed along by \texttt{B} to the oracles. The responses are recorded and then passed back to \texttt{A}. The algorithm \texttt{B} works by finding two indices to augment the output of \texttt{A}. First, \texttt{B} finds the $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ query index $\mhl{a}$ corresponding to the first verification challenge computed by \texttt{A} used in verifying the purported forgery. Second, \texttt{B} inspects the transcript of \texttt{A} to find the anonymity set index $l$ in the transcript such that $c = c_{l+1}$ and $\mhl{\{R_k^{*}\} = \{R_{k,l}\}}$ and $\mhl{\{L_k^{*}\} = \{L_{k,l}\}}$. Now \texttt{B} outputs $idx = (\mhl{a, l})$ along with whatever \texttt{A} outputs. Clearly, \texttt{B} makes the same number of corruption oracle queries as \texttt{A}.

Note \texttt{B} succeeds whenever \texttt{A} does and runs in time at most $t$ just like \texttt{A}, except for some additional time $t_0$ to search the transcript for $idx$. Since \texttt{B} is suitable for use in the forking lemma, we can use $\mathcal{F}^B$ to construct \texttt{M}.

The algorithm $\mathcal{F}^B$ is granted oracle access to the same oracles as \texttt{B} except $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ and \texttt{SO}. The algorithm $\mathcal{F}^B$ simulates \texttt{SO} queries made by \texttt{B} by simple back-patching of $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ and simulates the other queries made to $\mhl{\mathcal{H}_0^s}$ queries made by \texttt{B} using the random tapes \textbf{h, h*} as described in Section 3.1. All other oracle queries made by \texttt{B} are passed along by $\mathcal{F}^B$ to the actual oracles and handed back to \texttt{B}.

Note that $\mathcal{F}^B$ runs in time $2(t + t_0)$ and (with probability at least $\epsilon (\frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta})$) outputs a pair of valid signature triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m', Q', \sigma')$. The messages and anonymity sets are selected before the fork point in the transcripts, so $m = m'$ and $Q = Q'$. Moreover, $\mathcal{F}^B$ makes at most $2\kappa'$ corruption queries. The challenges for the two transcripts are distinct since the forking algorithm outputs the failure symbol $\bot$ and terminates if the challenges for $c_{l+1}$ are the same in each transcript.
\[
c_{l+1} \leftarrow \mathcal{H}_0^s(\mhl{m \parallel Q \parallel \{L_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1} \parallel \{R_{k,l}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})}) \rightarrow c'_{l+1} 
\]
We wrap $\mathcal{F}^B$ in an algorithm \texttt{M} that plays \hl{the standard discrete logarithm game. In this game, the player \texttt{M} receives a single public key generated by its challenger with respect to a fixed group generator, and must respond with the corresponding discrete logarithm. We require that the discrete logarithm challenger set up its game such that the generator $G$ corresponds to the $j = 0$ index of $\bm{G}$, i.e. $G = G_{g(0)}$.} The algorithm \texttt{M} has corruption oracle access and runs $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a black box, \hl{responding to corruption oracle queries using keys it will generate itself}.

\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
Formally, \texttt{M} operates as follows.

{
    \renewcommand\labelenumi{(\theenumi)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \hl{\texttt{M} receives a public key $X$ from its challenger.}

        \item \hl{Sample $\{z_{i,j}\}_{i,j=0}^{q-1,d-1} \in \texttt{F}$.}
        
        \item \hl{Sets up $\nicefrac{d}{v}$-CLSAG public keys} $$\mhl{pk_i = (z_{i,0}, \ldots, z_{i,d-1}) \circ \bm{G} = (Z_{i,0}, \ldots, Z_{i,d-1})}$$ \hl{and then sets $Z_{i',0} = X$ for a randomly-sampled index $i'$.}

        \item \texttt{M} executes $\mathcal{F}^B$ in a black box, using \hl{$\mhl{\{pk_i\}_{i=0}^{q-1}}$} as input. Upon receiving a corruption query from $\mathcal{F}^B$ \hl{on some $pk_i, \; i \ne i'$, \texttt{M} responds with the corresponding discrete logarithms $\{z_{i,j}\}$, and fails if $i = i'$}.

        \item If $\mathcal{F}^B$ fails, or if $\mathcal{F}^B$ succeeds \hl{on a forking index $l$ not corresponding to the returned public key set to $pk_{i'}$, \texttt{M} fails.}

        \item Otherwise, \texttt{M} obtains two signature triples with the same message and ring, $(m, Q, \sigma), (m, Q, \sigma')$ \hl{and computes discrete logarithm $x$ for public key $X$ as follows:}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \hl{\texttt{M} computes the aggregated secret key $w_k$ for index $k = g(0)$:} \hl{$w_{g(0)} = \frac{s_{g(0),l} - s'_{g(0),l}}{c'_l - c_l}$}.

            \item \hl{\texttt{M} calculates aggregation coefficients $\{\mu_j\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$. If $\mu_0 = 0$ then \texttt{M} fails.}

            \item \hl{\texttt{M} finally obtains $x$}:
            \[\mhl{x = z_{i', 0} = \mu_0^{-1} \left(w_{g(0)} - \sum_{\forall j \neq 0: g(j)=g(0)}{\mu_j z_{i',j}}\right)} \]
            
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \item \hl{\texttt{M} outputs $x$}.        
    \end{enumerate}
}

\hl{We observe that the index $i'$ is sampled uniformly at random in advance, and is unknown to the forking algorithm and forger; further, the keys produced by \texttt{M} are sampled identically to that of its challenger. In particular, this means that the adversary cannot base its queries or responses on this index.

The intuition behind algorithm \texttt{M} is outlined below. \texttt{M} finds the following system of equations in the transcripts by inspecting the verification challenge queries:}
\[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
    \{L_{k,l}\} = \{s_{k,l} G_k + c_l W_{k,l}\} &= \{s'_{k,l} G_k + c'_l W_{k,l}\} \\
    \{R_{k,l}\} = \{s_{k,l} H_l + c_l \mathfrak{W}_k\} &= \{s'_{k,l} H_l + c'_l \mathfrak{W}_k\}
\end{aligned}}\]
\hl{\texttt{M} has enough information to compute}
\[\mhl{
    \{W_{k,l}\} = \left\{\frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l} G_k\right\}, \quad \{\mathfrak{W}_k\} = \left\{\frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l} H_l\right\}
}\]
\hl{and therefore \texttt{M} can compute the aggregated secret keys $w_k = \frac{s_{k,l} - s'_{k,l}}{c'_l - c_l}$, including $w_{g(0)}$, corresponding to the first generator $G_{g(0)}$ and satisfying equation:}
\[\mhl{w_{g(0)} \cdot G_{g(0)} = \sum_{\forall j: g(j)=g(0)} \mu_j Z_{i',j}}\]
\hl{Because \texttt{M} replaces $Z_{i',0} = X$ for a randomly-sampled index $i'$ and because of the collision resistance implied by the weighting coefficients, this means:}
\[\mhl{w_{g(0)} = \mu_0x + \sum_{\forall j\neq0: g(j)=g(0)} \mu_j z_{i',j}}\]
\hl{where $x$ is the intended discrete logarithm that \texttt{M} needs to find. Clearly, as \texttt{M} knows $\{\mu_j\}$ and $\{z_{i',j}\}_{j \neq 0}$, it can calculate $x$}.


Denote with $t_1$ the time it takes for \texttt{M} to inspect the transcript, perform field \hl{and group} operations, and process corruption queries for $\mathcal{F}^B$. Then the algorithm \texttt{M} runs in time at most $2(t + t_0) + t_1$.

To complete the proof, consider the overall success probability and timing of \texttt{M}. \hl{As mentioned above, the likelihood that the forking algorithm $\mathcal{F}^B$ fails is $\epsilon ( \frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta} )$. The likelihood that the forger does not corrupt the challenge key $pk_{i'}$ in its at most $\kappa'$ corruption oracle queries is described by a hypergeometric distribution, and is bounded by $(q-\kappa')/q$.
The forking algorithm $\mathcal{F}^B$ runs the forger twice, so the likelihood that neither forger queries on this key is bounded by $((q-\kappa')/q)^2$.}

\hl{Note, that \texttt{M} fails if it obtains $\mu_0 = 0$. However, the likelihood that $\mu_0 = 0$ is negligible under the random oracle model.}

\hl{Finally, for \texttt{M} to succeed, the public key set returned by the forking algorithm for its forgeries must contain $pk_{i'}$ at the forking point, noting that both forgeries fork at the same point using a common public key set.
This likelihood is therefore bounded by $1/q$.}

\hl{This means that the overall likelihood that \texttt{M} succeeds is bounded by} $$\mhl{\left( \frac{q-\kappa'}{q} \right)^2 \epsilon \left( \frac{\epsilon}{q} - \frac{1}{2^\eta} \right) \left( \frac{1}{q} \right)}$$ \hl{and scales as $O(\epsilon^2)$.}

\end{claimproof}

The proof of \cref{t_2} demonstrates that the validity of a triple implies that the aggregated private key\hl{s $w_k$ are} the discrete logarithms of the aggregated linking tag\hl{s $\mathfrak{W}_k$} with respect to $H_l$ and \hl{are} also the discrete logarithm\hl{s} of the aggregated key\hl{s $W_{k,l}$} with respect to $\mhl{G_k}$. In this way, the linking tag of a valid signature must be the linking tag corresponding to at least one ring member, except possibly with negligible probability.

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{corollary}[\textbf{No Alien Linking Tags}]
If there exists a PPT algorithm \texttt{A} that produces a valid signature triple $(m, Q, \sigma)$ with the scheme in \cref{d_dclsag}, then there exists a ring member in $Q$ whose aggregated key\hl{s $W_{k,l}$ have} the same discrete logarithm\hl{s $w_k$} with respect to $\mhl{G_k}$ as \hl{$\mathfrak{W}_k$ have} with respect to $H_l$, and \hl{these $w_k$ are} known to \texttt{A} (except possibly with negligible probability).
\end{corollary}

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{theorem} \label{t_3}
The scheme in \cref{d_dclsag} is linkable under Definition 5 and Definition 6.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We show that valid, non-oracle signature triples from the scheme in \cref{d_dclsag} satisfying the corrupted key conditions in the game of Definition 5 always link. Hence, any algorithm fails at that game except with negligible probability.

    Assume that \texttt{A}, while playing the game of ACST linkability from Definition 5, produces a pair of valid, non-oracle signature triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m^*, Q^*, \sigma^*)$ such that at most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. This algorithm can be forked and rewound as above to compute the aggregated private key used in computing each signature, say $\mhl{\bm{w}=\{w_{g(j)}\}, \bm{w^*}=\{w_{g(j)}^*\},\ j=0 \dots d-1}$. At most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. Since \texttt{A} has knowledge of $\mhl{\bm{w}}$, then $\mhl{\bm{w}}$ is corrupted or outside of $S$, and likewise $\mhl{\bm{w^*}}$ is corrupted or outside of $S$. Since at most one key in $Q \cup Q^*$ can be corrupted or outside of $S$, we conclude $\mhl{\bm{w} = \bm{w^*}}$.

    Since key aggregation is preimage-resistant by its construction using hash functions and $\mhl{\bm{w} \circ \bm{G}}$ is the aggregated public key for some public key $\mhl{\bm{pk}_l = (\{Z_{l,j}\}_j)} \in Q \cap Q^*$, $\mhl{\bm{w}}$ must be aggregated from a private key $\mhl{(\{z_{l,j}\}_j)}$ using the aggregation function. In both the case of single-key-oriented linkability and full-key-oriented linkability, the linkability tags are therefore exactly equal. Hence, with probability 1, the pair of triples $(m, Q, \sigma), (m^*, Q^*, \sigma^*)$ are linked, and \texttt{A} fails at ACST linkability except with negligible probability.

    Similarly, an algorithm that outputs $q+1$ unlinked signatures can be rewound to compute $2(q+1)$ signatures from which $q+1$ aggregated keys can be computed. Moreover, if these signatures are unlinked, then the $q + 1$ aggregated keys are distinct, violating $q$-pigeonhole linkability.
\end{proof}

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{theorem} \label{t_4}
If there exists a $(t, \epsilon, q)$-solver of the linkable anonymity game of Definition 9 under the construction of \cref{d_dclsag}, then there exists a $(t + t', \epsilon/2, q)$-solver of the RO-DDH\hl{\footnote{\hl{In this theorem and its proof we employ a slightly modified version of the RO-DDH (as defined in Definition 2), where the fixed generator $G$ is replaced with the fixed generator $G_{g(0)}$.}}} game of Definition 2 for some $t'$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let \texttt{A} be such a solver of the linkable anonymity game. We will construct an algorithm \texttt{B} that executes \texttt{A} in a black box and is a solver of the RO-DDH game, acting as the challenger for \texttt{A}; the algorithm will pass on $\mathcal{H}^p$ random oracle queries to its own challenger, flip coins for $\mhl{\{\mathcal{H}_j^s\}}$ random oracle queries, and simulate signing oracle queries by backpatching. We assume that \texttt{B} keeps internal tables to maintain consistency between the random oracle queries needed to simulate signing oracle queries.

The algorithm \texttt{B} operates as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] \texttt{B} receives a set of tuples $\{(R_i, R'_i, R''_i)\}_{i=0}^{q-1}$ from its challenger, and chooses a bit $b' \in \{0, 1\}$ uniformly at random. Note that \texttt{B} does not know if its tuples are RO-DDH triples or not, as its challenger chose a secret bit $b \in \{0,1\}$ uniformly at random to determine this.

    \item[--] For all $i \in [0; q)$, \texttt{B} defines $\mhl{Z_{i,0}} \coloneqq R_i$ and records the $\mathcal{H}^p$ oracle mapping $\mathcal{H}^p(\mhl{Z_{i,0}}) = R'_i$. It chooses $\{z_{i,j}\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ from $\texttt{F}_p$ uniformly at random, and builds a set of public keys $S \coloneqq \{\mhl{(Z_{i,0}, z_{i,1}G_{g(1)}, \dots, z_{i,d-1}G_{g(d-1)})}\}_{i=0}^{q-1}$. \texttt{B} provides the set $S$ to \texttt{A}.

    \item[--] \texttt{A} returns indices $0 \leq i_0,i_1 < q$ to \texttt{B}.

    \item[--] \texttt{B} receives signing oracle queries of the form \texttt{SO}$(m, Q, pk)$, where $0 \leq l < q$ is the index of $pk \in Q, pk \in S$, and $|Q| = n$. There are two cases, which determine how \texttt{B} simulates the oracle response, flipping coins for $\mhl{\{\mathcal{H}_j^s\}}$ oracle queries:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If it is the case that $\{pk_{i_0}, pk_{i_1}\} \not\subset Q$ or $pk \notin \{pk_{i_0},pk_{i_1}\}$, then \texttt{B} proceeds with its signing oracle simulation using the key $pk$.

        \item Otherwise, there exists a bit $c \in \{0, 1\}$ such that $pk = pk_{i_c}$. In this case, \texttt{B} sets $c' \coloneqq c \oplus b'$ and proceeds with its signing oracle simulation using the key $pk_{i_{c'}}$. This is, if $b' = 0$, then \texttt{B} simulates a signature using the requested key from the player-provided index set. If instead $b' = 1$, then \texttt{B} simulates a signature using the other key.
    \end{enumerate}

    In either case, \texttt{B} parses the public key set $Q$ provided by \texttt{A}. For any key $pk_i \coloneqq (\mhl{Z'_{i,0}, Z'_{i,1}, \dots, Z'_{i, d-1}}) \in Q \setminus S$, it makes oracle queries to its challenger to obtain $\mathcal{H}^p(\mhl{Z'_{i,0}})$. Then \texttt{B} simulates the signature:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Define a map $\pi : [0, n) \rightarrow[0, q) \cup \{ \bot \}$ that maps indices of elements of $Q$ to the corresponding elements of $S$ (or returns the distinguished failure symbol $\bot$ for indices not mapping to elements of $S$), and let $0 \leq l < n$ be the index of $pk \in Q$.

        \item Choose $c_l, \mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i=0}^{v-1,n-1}} \in \texttt{F}_p$ uniformly at random.

        \item Since $pk \in S$ by construction, $\pi(l) \neq \bot$. Set $\mathfrak{T} \mhl{\coloneqq \mathfrak{D}_0} \coloneqq R''_{\pi(l)}$ and $\{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=1}^{d-1}$ such that each $\mathfrak{D}_j \coloneqq z_{\pi(l),j} \mathcal{H}^p(Z_{\pi(l),0})$.

        \item Define the following:
        \[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
            \mu_j &\leftarrow \mathcal{H}_j^s(Q, \{\mathfrak{D}_j\}_{j=0}^{d-1}) \hspace{30pt} \text{for} \ j \in [0, d)
            \\
            W_{k,i} &\coloneqq \left\{ \begin{aligned}
                &\sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j Z_{\pi(i),j} \quad &(\pi(i) \neq \bot)
                \\
                &\sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j Z'_{i,j} \quad &(\pi(i) = \bot)
            \end{aligned}\right.
            \\
            \mathfrak{W}_k &\coloneqq \sum_{j:g(j)=k} \mu_j \mathfrak{D}_j
        \end{aligned}}\]

        \item For each $i = l, l+1, \dots, n-1, 0, \dots, l-1$ (that is, indexing modulo $n$), define the following:
        \[\mhl{\begin{aligned}
            L_{k,i} &\coloneqq s_{k,i} G_k + c_i W_{k,i}
            \\
            R_{k,i} &\coloneqq \left\{ \begin{aligned}
                & s_{k,i} \mathcal{H}^p(Z_{\pi(i),0}) + c_i \mathfrak{W}_k \quad & (\pi(i) \neq \bot)
                \\
                & s_{k,i} \mathcal{H}^p(Z'_{i,0}) + c_i \mathfrak{W}_k \quad & (\pi(i) = \bot )
            \end{aligned}\right.
            \\
            c_{i+1} &\leftarrow \mathcal{H}_0^s(m, Q, \{L_{k,i}\}_{k=0}^{v-1}, \{R_{k,i}\}_{k=0}^{v-1})
        \end{aligned}}\]
    
        \item \texttt{B} returns to \texttt{A} the tuple $(c_0, \mhl{\{s_{k,i}\}_{k=0,i=0}^{v-1,n-1}, \{\mathfrak{D}_j\}})$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item[--] \texttt{A} returns a bit $b^*$ to \texttt{B}.

    \item[--] If $b^* = b'$, then \texttt{B} returns $0$ to its challenger. Otherwise, it returns 1.
\end{itemize}

It is the case that \texttt{B} wins the RO-DDH game precisely when it correctly guesses the bit $b$ chosen by its challenger. Hence $\mathbb{P}[\text{\texttt{B} wins}] = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \ \rightarrow \ 0 | b = 0] + \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \ \rightarrow \ 1 | b = 1]$.

If $b = 1$, then the RO-DDH challenger provided random points $\{R''_i\}$ that \texttt{B} used in its simulated signatures, so \texttt{A} can do no better than random chance at determining $b'$. Since $\texttt{B} \rightarrow 1$ exactly when \texttt{A} loses the linkable anonymity game, we have $\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \rightarrow 1 | b = 1] = \frac{1}{2}$.

On the other hand, if $b = 0$, then the RO-DDH challenger provided structured tuples that \texttt{B} used in its simulated signatures, and \texttt{A} wins the linkable anonymity game with non-negligible advantage $\epsilon$ over random chance. Since $\texttt{B} \rightarrow 0$ exactly when \texttt{A} wins the linkable anonymity game, we have $\mathbb{P}[\texttt{B} \rightarrow 0 | b = 0] = \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$.

This means \texttt{B} wins the RO-DDH game with probability $\mathbb{P}[\text{\texttt{B} wins}] = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and has non-negligible advantage $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Further, \texttt{B} finishes with an added time $t'$ used in simulating oracle queries and performing lookups. Hence, \texttt{B} is a $(t + t', \epsilon/2, q)$-solver of the RO-DDH game.
